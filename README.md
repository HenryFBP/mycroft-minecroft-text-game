## Development

See <https://github.com/HenryFBP/VirtualMachineConfigs/tree/master/vagrant/ubuntu-mycroft>

You must first run the commands in the above repo to set up a Mycroft development environment.

And also run

    pushd ~/Git/mycroft-core/
    bash start-mycroft.sh all
    source venv-activate.sh
    mycroft-cli-client

You may need to then navigate to <https://account.mycroft.ai/> to pair the Mycroft CLI client.

### Editor

I use PyCharm,

With a venv path of:

    /home/vagrant/Git/mycroft-core/.venv/bin/python3
